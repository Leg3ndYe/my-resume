    <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            I am a person ready for lifelong learning, I like to work in a team and 
            gain new experiences and knowledge that way. I am curious and responsible for my own 
            actions. I am able to quickly acquire new knowledge and skills.
            I have a desire to prove myself in my work and achieve success in 
            tasks that will be assigned to me.
            I am communicative and open. I believe in my qualities and I look forward to meeting
            new people, making BBQ and playing Pool with them.

                        <p>Whenever I have some free time I usually spend it with my girlfriend playing 
                            games or if she is not around I tend to go play some MMORPG or Fortnite with
                            friends online.

                        <p>Since I was little there was always something about those beasts on 2 wheels. 
                            Whenever I see one, my heart starts racing. I love to spend time around motorcycles,
                            riding them or even just looking at them.

                <li>Reading
                    <ul style="font-weight: 100;">
                        <p>There are days in a month where I just like to pick up a book and start reading it.
                            It makes me calm and puts my mind at ease.
                        <p>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Anime
                    <ul style="font-weight: 100;">
                        <p>Anime has been with me from when I was a little kid watching Yu-Gi-Oh and 
                            Dragon Ball Z on a thick box like looking TV. I has stuck with me since then and I 
                            don't plan on "unstucking" it. Watching Anime I had learned some of the most valuable life lessons.
